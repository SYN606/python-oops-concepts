What is a operator ?
operator is a instruction for a program that tells how to execute the code sequentially and generate the desired logic.

python has given below operators :---->

1 -> Arithmetic
These type of operators are used in doing mathematical calculations.

.==================.=====================================.
|   Operator       |             Description             |
|                  |                                     |
.==================.=====================================.
|      +           |          used in addition           |
|      -           |          used in subtraction        |
|      *           |          used to multiply           |
|      /           |          used to divide             |
|      //          |  used to calculate floor division   |
|      %           |  used to calculate the modulus      |
|      **          |  used to calculate exponent(power)  |                               
.==================.=====================================. 

|> difference b/w / and // -------->
    
    / (single forward slash) used ot calculate division that mean it returns values in flaot data type.
    for example 
    
    print(10/2)
    this will return 5.0 and thats a float data type.
    on the other hand // (double forward slash) returns values in integer format like 3.9 it will return 3.
    floor division has a con that is sometime for precise calculation we want float data but when we use it,
    the data is lose by which that mean we cant do exact calculations.

|> what is (%) modulus ?
    modulus (%) is used to calculate the reminder of of a division.

    print(11 % 2)
    this line will return 1 that is reminder of 10 / 2.

    NOTE :
        If we print 11 / 2 that will return 2.5 because it is normal division.
        If we print 11 // 2 that will print 2 because it is floor division and always return integer not float.
        If we print 11 % 2 that will return 1 because 1 is the reminder when 11 is not fully divided.

|> what is (**) exponent ?
    exponent (**) is used to calculate power for example 
    print(3 ** 2)
    that means (3)^2 that will print square of 3.
2 -> Comparison
Comparison operators are used for comparing two variable value, this is also known as Relational operators.

3 -> Assignment
4 -> logical
5 -> Bitwise
6 -> membership
7 -> identity
