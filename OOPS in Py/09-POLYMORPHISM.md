# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) encompasses several key concepts that form the foundation of designing and organizing code. Among these, the four fundamental principles are:

1. **Abstraction**
   - Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors, while ignoring non-essential details. It involves creating abstract classes and interfaces to define a blueprint for objects.

2. **Encapsulation**
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. It promotes the idea of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary. This helps in achieving better organization and security in code.

3. **Inheritance**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class/parent class). It promotes code reusability and the establishment of a hierarchical relationship among classes.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Polymorphism is a concept that refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and interfaces, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code.

These four principles collectively contribute to building robust, modular, and maintainable software systems using the principles of object-oriented design.
